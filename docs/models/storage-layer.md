# Storage layers

A storage layer is a stage in which jobs do not need to be processed, i.e., they do not have any processing times. 
Instead, the intervals are constrained by intra-stage constraints.

Moreover, storage layers (in the application in compound feed production) must take into account multi-level product characteristics to avoid contamination of goods.
In this example, we assume that the jobs are _products_, which consists of one or multiple production batches.
Both "jobs" need to be scheduled, but some constraints only apply to the products, whereas some only apply to the batches.

The machine layout consists of a set of production lines, each of which consists of one unrelated machine (i.e., storage) unit.

This model uses the following variables:

- $T_b$: interval variable for batch $b$
- $Tp_b$: interval variable for product $p$
- $Ap_{pi}$: interval assignment variable for product $p$ on machine $i$
- $Sp_i$: sequence variable of product assignment variables on machine $i$

We do not need to take into account batch assignment variables, since that is covered by the product assignment variables.
